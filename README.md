###BACKEND
The microservice was developed in Java 11 with Spring Boot and to save information I use a no relational database - MongoDB

##Resources
*Java 11
*Spring Boot
*AWS
*MongoDB Cloud


### Getting started

Clone Project to a path of your computer, then open with ide, I use Intellij IDEA or Spring Tools Suite,
but i love IntelliJ IDEA because I can work Backend and Frontend in a single ide.

Then execute maven update for download the dependencies.

##Testing

For Testing the Microservice is deployed in AWS and this is the endpoint, copy in postman
