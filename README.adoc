= Project For Michael Page 



= BACKEND

The microservice was developed in Java 11 with Spring Boot and to save information I use a no relational database - MongoDB

== Resources
* Java 11
* Spring Boot
* AWS
* MongoDB Cloud

== Getting Started

Clone Project to a path of your computer, then open with ide, I use Intellij IDEA or Spring Tools Suite,
but i love IntelliJ IDEA because I can work Backend and Frontend in a single ide.

Then execute maven update for download the dependencies.

== Testing
the swagger documentation is:
http://itretailmscliente-env.g3aeth4psa.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/itretail/swagger-ui.html#/client-controller/[Swagger Documentation]

For Testing the Microservice is deployed in AWS and this is the endpoint, copy in postman the next
